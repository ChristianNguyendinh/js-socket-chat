### Real TODOS:     
  
maybe a join method for server side, same code used in join, create and add server    
deal with duplicate names/rooms  
deleting rooms? Maybe not  
have room tab blink or something when a user talks or joins, have it go away when switch to room  
timestamps for messages
... animation for user is typing... ?
