TODO:  
  
implement chat ROOMS. user list will have tab similar to current. display users in each room there. join button next to each room?  
  
Real TODOS:  
Display users in room  
Perform default actions after user joins 
Option to Create Room   
Display user joined in room they joined    
Have typing only displayed if user currently in that room. Maybe change to show up on the box...  
Make sure changing tabs isn't doing more than it needs to. Same with join button  
--------  

convert var to let for some variables
have room tab blink or something when joining  
option to leave rooms
